# 🎭 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis using Video

### 🗣️ Introduction

To judge a person's sentiment, we need more than just their words. A text-based sentence cannot be interpreted as positive or negative just by itself. That is where the person's expressions and sound come into play. A person's expression and audio can have a lot of impact on the sentiment and may actually give better insights about a particular statement. 

**Example**: `"He made a decision that changed everything."`<br>
*Positive Interpretation:* The decision led to unexpected success, positive outcomes, or personal growth.<br>
*Negative Interpretation:* The decision resulted in unforeseen challenges, negative consequences, or regrettable outcomes.

Such sentences can cause confusion about what the sentence actually wanted to convey since no context is provided. On the other hand, if these words were paired with a video of the person talking, we may be able to interpret the sentence based on the expressions and the tone of the person.

### 🎯 Our Aim

In this project, we will be attempting to create a model which will output the sentiment of the person not just from their words, but also from their expressions and their tone.
